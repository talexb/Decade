# Decade
Find the decades in which all four possible primes are primes

2021-0701: Based on a query posed to me by my Dad, a retired actuary.

It's possible that the numbers ending in 1, 3, 7 and 9 within a decade are all prime; for example, the numbers in the first decade (11, 13, 17, 19) satisfy this condition.
How many more are there?

These scripts answer that question by 1. Generating prime numbers, and then 2. Using those prime numbers to find matching decades.

It turns out that there are 898 decades that meet that condition, searching through the primes below 10,000,000.
